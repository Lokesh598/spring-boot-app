# spring-boot-app workflow

Spring Boot is a framework for building web applications using the Spring framework. It simplifies the process of creating and configuring Spring applications by providing a set of pre-configured options and dependencies.

When a Spring Boot application is run, the following process occurs:

1. The application's main class is loaded and executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

2. The main class uses the SpringApplication class to start the application. The SpringApplication class is responsible for setting up the Spring context, which is the container that holds all of the application's components, such as controllers, services, and repositories.

3. The SpringApplication class also loads any configuration files or properties specified in the application's configuration. These configurations include things like database connections, security settings, and other application-specific settings.

4. The SpringApplication class then scans the classpath for any components or beans that are annotated with Spring annotations, such as @Controller, @Service, or @Repository. These annotations tell Spring that these classes should be treated as components and 
should be included in the application's context.

5. Once all of the components have been found and added to the context, the SpringApplication class starts the embedded web server (such as Tomcat or Jetty) that will handle incoming requests.

6. When a request is made to the application, the web server routes the request to the appropriate controller, which then handles the request and returns a response. The controller may also use services and repositories to interact with the application's data and perform any necessary business logic.

7. Once the response has been generated, it is sent back to the client by the web server.

Overall Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can "just run" and it significantly reduces the complexity of configuring and setting up a Spring application.
